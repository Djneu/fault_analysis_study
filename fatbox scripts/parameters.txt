**** Parameters and thresholds used when running the analysis ****

**Note: image data from paraview needs to be extracted into CSV files to run analysis

XPIX=2880                  # X pixels from paraview export
Xlength=450                # Length of exported window in km
YPIX=448                   # Y pixels from paraview export
STRAIN_RATE_FACTOR=0.1     # Threshold for factor of plastic strain to include.
MINDISTANCE=1.5            # Minimum distance to correlate points from skeletonize to a fault.
RAD=5                      # Radius in pixels to correlate faults through time             
min_fault_length=1.5       # Threshold for minimum fault length in km
